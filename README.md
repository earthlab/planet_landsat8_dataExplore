# planet_landsat8_dataExplore
This repo contains a series of notebooks which compare PlanetScope imagery to Landsat 8 OLI imagery. Note that the source imagery would need to be downloaded to run these notebooks, but the code is relevant to any data one would want to compare.

There are also a few .py files which contain functions used in the notebooks. E.g., planet_helpers2.py (most up to date) helps parse out date and other metadata from planet xml files. If the metadata format has changed, the code should be updated.
